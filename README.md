# DesigningSoundMusicSystem

Source code companion to a Designing Sound tutorial series on making interactive music systems in the Unity3d game engine.

Hopefully, this can serve as a jumping off point for making interactive and/or generative music systems for games. As much detail as possible is provided in the code comments, and some explanation of some of the thought processes and theory are available in the articles linked below.
